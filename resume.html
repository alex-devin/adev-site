          <h3>New Concepts for Infrared Tests in Production</h3>
          <img src="images/bachelorsthesiscover.png" alt="New Concepts for Infrared Tests in Production - Alex DeVincenzo and Marcus Christensson">
          <p>As part of my thesis at Axis Communications AB, I co-developed a new, efficient method for testing infrared light in security cameras. The existing process was cumbersome and required different apparatuses for various camera models. Our innovative solution, created with Marcus Christensson, features a universal test apparatus that integrates both hardware and software, eliminating the need for recalibration. The system, which is easy to use and compatible with Axis's TestStand software, was successfully built and tested, demonstrating promising results with actual Axis camera data.</p>
