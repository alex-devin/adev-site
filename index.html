    <!-- //  ABOUT ME  // -->
    <main>
      <p>I'm an Electrical Engineer, I hold a Bachelors of Science and studied at Lund University. I currently work as a full stack software developer.</p>
      <p>As a Full Stack Software Engineer at NBC Sports, I managed the complete development lifecycle of a golf video streaming and subscription website, designing responsive front-end interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and developing efficient back-end solutions with Java and C#. I managed databases, integrated video streaming capabilities, collaborated with UX/UI designers, and ensured the platform's performance, security, and scalability. At HRSoft, I gathered customer requirements, configured software products, and performed QA testing using agile methodologies. My role included defect management, SQL programming, and designing web interfaces. Additionally, I developed hardware and software solutions for testing infrared lighting in security cameras during my tenure at Axis Communications AB and held leadership roles at Lund Technical University, facilitating student learning in various technical subjects.</p>
